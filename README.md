###Onboarding
- A user rockets through the onboarding flow, selecting (and falling in love with) the beautifully curated templates representing the promise of what their website could be. The feeling of ownership was enough to get them to sign up with their name and email.
- They mostly skipped or ignored the intro video and had some trouble navigating off of it. And then, once in the editor — some picked up on the cues and some didn’t. Those that struggled generally had difficulty understanding what they were editing and how to view these edits.
- Inconsistency across templates caused a lot of confusion
- BETTER: Have new users land in “Preview” mode instead of the editor (this already happens when switching templates). - Allow them to begin to dabble with text content in the same framework as they were first exposed to it, creating a sense of familiarity and creating content that will ground them in the Content manager when they get there later.

###Additional Usability
- Too many options
- Don’t need options until relevant.
- Create a thesaurus of terms so that people who have used other products can apply previous mental models and still  find aid in the supporting documentation.
- Browser Navigation - When used give message suggesting likely things they’re trying to find?  


##[Onboarding First Date](http://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/design/ux-flows-onboarding)

- As charming as possible, don’t talk their ear off
- Tell them only what they need to know, in as few words as possible.
- Be witty and delightful
- This is the IKEA build manual with an ulterior motive - to use the chair
